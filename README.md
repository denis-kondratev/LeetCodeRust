# Solving LeetCode Problems in Rust

Hi! In this repository, I solve LeetCode problems using the Rust programming
language and gradually get used to the intricate world of ownership and borrowing.

Rust offers a fresh perspective after C++. The language ensures memory
safety and prevents an entire class of bugs at compile time, while also
forcing you to rethink the familiar approach to algorithm design.

Of course, Rust has its downsides — for example, compilation can
be significantly slower compared to C++ or Go. But let’s see where
this all leads — I hope Rust continues to grow, and that a bright
future awaits us all :)

If someone finds my notes and thoughts helpful, I’ll be absolutely
delighted. Welcome — let’s explore the nuances of Rust together!
